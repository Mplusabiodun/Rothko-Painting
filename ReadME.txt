ROTHKO PAINTING

Rothko's paintings often consist of large, rectangular fields of color, usually with softened edges. 
These color fields are designed to evoke emotional responses and contemplation. The artist believed 
that color had the power to communicate complex emotions and create a profound experience for the viewer.
